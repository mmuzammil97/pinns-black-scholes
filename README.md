# pinns-black-scholes
We describe the use of Physics Informed Neural Network to solve the Black-Scholes Equation. As a preliminary example, we work through the Heat Equation and the 1D Damped Harmonic Oscillator. 
The 1D damped harmonic oscillator is inspired by Ben Moseley's super instructive tutorial.
